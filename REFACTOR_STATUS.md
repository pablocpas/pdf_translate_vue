# PDF Translator Refactoring Status

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Shared Configuration & Models
- ✅ `shared/config/` - Centralized configuration system
- ✅ `shared/models/` - Pydantic models and exceptions
- ✅ `shared/utils/` - Common utilities (file, logging, validation)

### 2. Backend Refactoring  
- ✅ `backend/main.py` - Simplified FastAPI app with factory pattern
- ✅ `backend/api/routes/` - Modular route handlers (health, upload, translation, download)
- ✅ `backend/api/middleware/` - Error handling middleware
- ✅ `backend/services/` - Business logic services (file, translation, task)
- ✅ `backend/tests/` - Test structure with fixtures

### 3. Worker Refactoring
- ✅ `worker/tasks.py` - Simplified Celery task definitions
- ✅ `worker/core/orchestrator.py` - Main workflow coordinator
- ✅ `worker/core/document/` - Document analysis, extraction, reconstruction
- ✅ `worker/core/translation/` - Translation engine and OpenAI client
- ✅ `worker/core/fonts/` - Font management system
- ✅ `worker/infrastructure/` - Celery config and OCR adapters

### 4. Development Setup
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies organized
- ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python project config
- ✅ `Makefile` - Development commands
- ✅ `.env.example` - Environment configuration template

## 🚨 Current Issue
- **Pydantic Version Conflict**: Using BaseSettings from pydantic v1 but system has v2
- **Need to resolve**: Either downgrade pydantic or update to pydantic-settings

## 🧪 Testing Status - DOCKER REQUIRED
- ⏸️ **Stopped at**: About to start systematic testing
- **CRITICAL**: All tests must run in Docker due to LayoutParser/Detectron2 environment sensitivity
- **Next**: Test in Docker containers, fix pydantic imports if needed

## 📋 Testing Strategy (Docker-First)
1. **Build Docker images** - Update containers with refactored code
2. **Test shared modules** - Import and configuration tests in worker container
3. **Test backend API** - Health checks and endpoint validation
4. **Test worker processing** - LayoutParser and translation pipeline
5. **Test full integration** - End-to-end PDF translation workflow
6. **Fix environment issues** - Dependencies, GPU access, model downloads

## 🔧 Architecture Changes Made

### Problems Solved:
- ❌ 457-line monolithic main.py → ✅ Modular 50-line focused modules
- ❌ Duplicated Celery config → ✅ Centralized configuration
- ❌ Mixed responsibilities → ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ❌ Generic error handling → ✅ Typed exceptions with context
- ❌ Hardcoded values → ✅ Centralized constants

### New Structure:
```
shared/          # Common code
backend/         # FastAPI service  
worker/          # Celery processing
├── core/        # Business logic
├── infrastructure/ # External services
└── tests/       # Test suites
```

## 🎯 Key Files to Check in WSL:
- `shared/config/base.py` - May need pydantic fix
- `backend/main.py` - Should work after imports fixed  
- `worker/tasks.py` - Core task definitions
- `docker-compose.yml` - May need PYTHONPATH updates for shared modules
- `TESTING_PLAN.md` - **Complete Docker testing strategy**

## 📦 Docker-Specific Considerations:
- **LayoutParser**: Requires specific environment, model downloads
- **Detectron2**: GPU-sensitive, complex dependencies  
- **Shared modules**: Need proper PYTHONPATH in containers
- **Model caching**: First run will download models (slow)
- **Volume mounts**: Ensure shared code accessible in containers

## 🚀 Next Steps in WSL:
1. Read `TESTING_PLAN.md` - Complete Docker testing strategy
2. `docker-compose build --no-cache` - Fresh build with refactored code
3. Follow systematic testing phases
4. Fix any import/dependency issues in Docker context
